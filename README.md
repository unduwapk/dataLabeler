# DataLabeler
### Help make it easy to label data in a game like format. 

To run the program, open into your terminal. Go into the file path you loaded the files into. 
Type "python dataLabelGame.py"


In this game, you will provide a file path location to a list of images that needs to be labeled. 
Then within the game, users will label them as they see fit. 
The labels for each file will get saved in a csv file. 
The images will also get sorted into a new folder based on each label.
